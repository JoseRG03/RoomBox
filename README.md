## About

This app is part of a 3-module system for a fictional furniture shop, with this module being the client-facing storefront.
Customers can do the following activities:
    - Shop online for their favorite products
    - Scan QR codes to add products they like to their cart (in a real-world setting, this would be done inside the store)
    - Self check-out
